# ToDo_App_Gui_Desktop
A desktop version of the ToDo APP

To make a standalone desktop aplication on Windows I used a PyInstaller.

When we install a PyInstaller we have to go to the terminal.

In the terminal we write: "pyinstaller -- onefile --windowed --clean main.py 
(or another name of the file with extension .py)"

--onefile means creating one executable file instead of several scattered ones.

--windowed means opening a file without a command line.

--clean means that - if we previously generated an executable file, clean will replace that file.

In the nerby future I will add description how to make executable file on MacOS an linux.

Stay tune!
